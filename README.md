Hello!
My name is Max, I'm Finnish, and at the time of writing this I'm taking my first steps into the world of coding. 
I've been doing introductory courses to C, C++, Python as well as HTML & CSS. (the latter two I've been learning through a web development course I've yet to finish.)
Hopefully it wont be long until I'll find work coding and then I can improve my skills through new challenges. Until then I'll just keep on learning whatever I can.
